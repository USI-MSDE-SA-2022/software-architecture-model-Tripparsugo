<p>For skiers
Who are deciding where to spend their day
The Skip app
Is  an application for mobile devices
That allows skiers upload and visualize information ubout the current state of the slopes.
Unlike companies that manage the slopes Skip provides its users with unbiased information on the state of the snow.
There are websites that host reviews of ski resorts  but those are permanent reviews and likely not based on the present snow conditions.
Skiers may also use forums to monitor the snow conditions (ex: <a href="https://www.skiforum.it/board/index.php?threads/55613/page-1966">https://www.skiforum.it/board/index.php?threads/55613/page-1966</a>) but this
requires the user to sift trhough multiple messages in the hopes of finding the information he needs
Our Project provides information and up to date data on the ski resorts close to the user at a glance.
This information is provided by users through a quick submission designed to be compiled in less than 30s.
Reviews by users are weighted based on how recent they are and expire after a while so that the information on the slopes is always up to date.</p>

<ol>
<li>What did you decide?</li>
</ol>
<p>Which platform should Skip run on.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>What was the context for your decision?</li>
</ol>
<p>We want to guarantee Skip users a good compromise of usability and utility at a
reasonable development cost.</p>
<p>The application should be as immediate as possible to access and push users to
give updates on the conditions of the slopes.</p>
<p>Another important factor to keep in mind is the &#39;effort&#39; that would be required
from the users part to start using the application for instance using a web app
doesn&#39;t require any installations.</p>
<p>This is a key decision that affects the marketing and design architecture of
the whole software:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>From a coding perspective programming languages available across platforms
are not the same. We also need to keep in mind that available computing power
vastly differs platform to platform</p>
</li>
<li><p>Best UI practices vastly differs on different platforms for instance a phone
has a smaller screen size and ratio compared to a desktop PC</p>
</li>
<li><p>There are revenue consequences based on these decisions, for instance mobile
app stores will take a portion of our profits but at the same time offer a more
ample access to the marketing</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>What is the problem you are trying to solve?</li>
</ol>
<p>What&#39;s the best way for users to access our service?</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Which alternative options did you consider?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Web app</li>
<li>Mobile app</li>
<li>Desktop</li>
<li>Mobile + Desktop</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li>Which one did you choose?</li>
</ol>
<p>Mobile</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>What is the main reason for that?</li>
</ol>
<p>Users need an interface to quickly access the applicable features and give updates
on the condition of the snow while on the slopes. Given most users will go skiing
with their smartphones rather than their computers we need to make the app available
on them. We can do so either via web app or mobile application, web apps tend to
be hard to use while on the snow so we need at least mobile app.</p>
<p>The application doesn&#39;t feature complex user interactions that would justify
the need of a desktop version. We also need to consider that a user from a Desktop
might use the app to evaluate the condition of the slopes but likely won&#39;t come
back home to open it again to provide feedback on their conditions which is something
our application needs.</p>
<p>PROS:</p>
<ul>
<li>not developing also a Desktop app saves component</li>
<li>the app store gives a large market access on the fly</li>
<li>the application will be easily accessible while skiing</li>
<li>it&#39;s easier to have a good design on a mobile app rather than a web apps</li>
</ul>
<p>CONS:</p>
<ul>
<li>revenue cut by app stores</li>
<li>users without a smartphone won&#39;t be able to access the application</li>
<li>more effort required from the users part to start using the application compared
to a web app</li>
<li>more expensive to develop a web app compared to a mobile one</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="adr-2">ADR #2</h2>
<ol>
<li>What did you decide?</li>
</ol>
<p>Which mobile OS should the application run on?</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>What was the context for your decision?</li>
</ol>
<p>We want our application to be accessible to the largest possible amount of users.
We need to consider that developing an app on multiple OS has a considerable impact
on developing costs.
Different technologies are available on different OS so this choice will impact
our code.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>What is the problem you are trying to solve?</li>
</ol>
<p>How can we make the application available to a large portion of our potential
users without a heavy impact on its usability and development costs?</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Which alternative options did you consider?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Android</li>
<li>IoS</li>
<li>X-platform</li>
<li>(Android &amp; IoS) native</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li>Which one did you choose?</li>
</ol>
<p>X-platform</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>What is the main reason for that?</li>
</ol>
<p>Excluding on of the OS would cut out a significant portion of our users as currently
the split between Android/Apple devices is roughly 7:3.
A x-platform solution allows to access both markets while at the same time
not bloating maintenance and development costs.
The tradeoff is in usability.</p>
<p>PROS:</p>
<ul>
<li>access to nearly all potential users</li>
<li>less expensive compared to a native solution</li>
</ul>
<p>CONS:</p>
<ul>
<li>more expensive compared to a single OS solution</li>
<li>no access to native OS specific features</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="adr-3">ADR #3</h2>
<ol>
<li>What did you decide?</li>
</ol>
<p>Which framework to use to implement the X-platform app.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>What was the context for your decision?</li>
</ol>
<p>Developing the application with a feature rich and reliable framework will
reduce costs and deliver a better product.</p>
<p>Programmers need to be able to work with the framework thus either they are
already comfortable with it or they will need to learn how to use it.</p>
<p>This decision has an impact on the code design.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>What is the problem you are trying to solve?</li>
</ol>
<p>How can we make our app as easy to implement as possible?</p>

<ol>
<li>What did you decide?</li>
</ol>
<p>How we should gain money from the application</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>What was the context for your decision?</li>
</ol>
<p>We need to make a profit from our application.</p>
<p>We need to consider that certain solution will impact the amount of users of the
application (ex: making the app paid) or impact the usability (ex: aggressive ads)</p>
<p>This decision is a marketing one but might slightly impact UI design and code if
we want to add ads to the application. For donations we will need to implement
a secure way to send them code-wise.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>What is the problem you are trying to solve?</li>
</ol>
<p>How can we profit from the application?</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Which alternative options did you consider?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>paid application</li>
<li>free application with ads</li>
<li>free application with donations</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li>Which one did you choose?</li>
</ol>
<p>free application with ads</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>What is the main reason for that?</li>
</ol>
<p>An application can only be paid if it offers a service indispensable for the
user while at the same time being by far the best
product available on the market (ex: photoshop).
Users will be very shy to download a paid app on the a mobile store in part given
the fierce competition on it.
That being said making the app paid would surely reduce the amount of users
in turn reducing the amount of snow updates we get from them.</p>
<p>At the cost of some usability ads can provide a steady flow of revenue without
the big barrier on the download an initial payment would be. We could also

<p>Donations don&#39;t impact the usability of the app but likely don&#39;t provide enough

<li>What did you decide?</li>
</ol>
<p>How to incentivise users to give snow updates</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>What was the context for your decision?</li>
</ol>
<p>We want users to provide as much updates on the condition of the snow as possible
to offer consistent and up to date reports.</p>
<p>We can&#39;t make the feedback too long or invasive or users won&#39;t compile it.</p>
<p>The incentives can&#39;t heavily impact the profits of our application.</p>
<p>This is a marketing decision with a minor impact on the code of the application
albeit way to give incentives will have to be implemented.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>What is the problem you are trying to solve?</li>
</ol>
<p>Users might not provide updates if they don&#39;t feel they gain something from it.
At the same time an incentive perceived as too large might prompt them to
leave fake updates</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Which alternative options did you consider?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>no incentives</li>
<li>small payment</li>
<li>lottery</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li>Which one did you choose?</li>
</ol>
<p>lottery</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>What is the main reason for that?</li>
</ol>
<p>By providing no incentives it would be up to the user&#39;s goodwill to leave updates
which might still happen (reviews exist even if no one gets paid for them).</p>
<p>We could issue small payment to users for their updates but these payments would
be so small in order to still manage to make a profit off the app that users might
perceive them as a &#39;job&#39; they are not getting paid enough to do.</p>
<p>A lottery of ski related items might be the best options since it doesn&#39;t cost
much compared to the perceived value from the user&#39;s part and might also introduce
the fun factor.</p>
<p>PROS:</p>
<ul>
<li>incentive for the users</li>
</ul>
<p>CONS:</p>
<ul>
<li>lotteries have to abide legal regulations</li>
<li>lottery still impacts operating costs albeit in a minor way</li>
<li>it might incentivise users to leave fake updates. A countermeasure needs to be

<p>The choice of  language that can scale well to write medium to large sized applications

maintainable, increase reliability (less bugs) and likely reduce our time to market
so it&#39;s a key decision.</p>

<li>What is the problem you are trying to solve?</li>
</ol>
<p>Writing programs is hard with the wrong technology so we want to pick the proper one.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Which alternative options did you consider?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Java + Spring</li>
<li>Kotlin + Spring</li>

</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li>Which one did you choose?</li>
</ol>
<p>Kotlin + Spring</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>What is the main reason for that?</li>
</ol>
<p>JS is very bug prone and while being a very quick solution for small scale applications
it doesn&#39;t scale well beyond that.</p>
<p>Java has consinstently proven itself to be a good language to develop sstable
backend and Spring is also a well tested framework in that regard.</p>
<p>While certainly being a solid language Java starts to show signs of its age and
due to retrocompatibility concerns it never solved some of its core issues (ex: null management)</p>
<p>Kotlin offers a more modern approach to OOP and is completely Interoperable with Java so
the transition to it shouldn&#39;t be traumatic for most programmers.</p>
<p>Ktor is a more modern framework but on the other hand it doesn&#39;t have the same amount
of material on it as we can find about Spring nor it&#39;s as easy to find people with
knowledge about it.</p>
<p>PROS:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kotlin is a statically typed language which will reduce the potential for bugs compared to JS</li>
<li>Kotlin solves key issues of Java such as excessive verbosity and null management</li>
<li>Spring is a well tested framework with lots of material on its usage</li>
</ul>
<p>CONS:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developing a backend in Kotlin might be slower than JS</li>

<img src="./puml_e47.svg"><p>Here&#39;s the Data aggregator section:</p>
<img src="./puml_e48.svg"><p>For the &quot;Data aggregator&quot; we are using a shared DB connector as explained with the
following ADR:</p>

<li>What did you decide?</li>
</ol>
<p>How the components fetching data for the backend SKIP should be connected</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>What was the context for your decision?</li>
</ol>
<p>We have different data sources that are processed to produce different types
of data by collectors which is then aggregated. Ideally this would not be
necessary but some collectors need to access data collected by other collectors.
For instance the weather collector needs the list of resorts he needs
to get the weather for.
Below a graph representing the situation:</p>
<img src="./puml_e49.svg"><ol start="3">
<li>What is the problem you are trying to solve?</li>
</ol>
<p>We want to avoid a potentially large processing time to be felt by users.</p>
<p>We want the coupling between the various collectors to be as loose as possible.</p>
<p>We want a flexible way to manipulate the ingested data.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Which alternative options did you consider?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Procedure Call</li>
<li>Bus</li>
<li>Shared DB</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li>Which one did you choose?</li>
</ol>
<p>Shared DB</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>What is the main reason for that?</li>
</ol>
<p>With a shared DB each collector is only coupled with the shape of the data he
needs to work with and doesn&#39;t need to directly communicate with other components
(with a procedure call we would have instead a very tigh coupling).
Due to the loose coupling we can easily scale our collectors to use multiple
sources and just need to provide appropiate adapters.</p>
<p>A shared DB can support mutual dependencies between two collectors
as the data will eventually converge with time. We also don&#39;t need to worry about
potential cascading updates that could be caused by one collector updating its
data (as would happen with a Bus).</p>
<p>A shared DB can potentially support very expressive queries if needed by the
collectors.</p>
<p>A shared DB allows to store collectors to store history if needed.</p>
<p>Data in a shared DB can be queried and analyzed outside of the application
if needed by the developpers.</p>
<p>With the newly adopted connector we have turned the aggregation and collection
of data into an active task to avoid the user having to wait for it.</p>
<p>This comes at the cost of more processing and calls required for potentially
unneeded data but we believe it to be worth the tradeoff.</p>
<p>The following process view shows the work behind a call to the API, as we cant
observe updates happen independently:</p>

<li><p>(5-6) These questions are about the implications on coupling based on the decisions you documented in the connector view.
Whenever you have a connector you couple together the components and different connectors will have different forms of coupling</p>

</li>
</ul>
</section><h1 id="1-2">1-2</h1>
<p>In this project we are using both adapters implemented by us and others
externally sourced.</p>
<p>The most prominent mimatch we find in our project is derived by the fact that
we are collecting data from different sources and have to reshape it for our
needs. Despite the components not communicating directly as they use a
shared database connector they still serve the role of adapting data, if not
through their interface by the way they ingest it in the shared database.</p>
<p>Each combination of data type and source needs its own adapter with
knowledge on how to retrive it and reshape it.</p>
<p>The following view (from ex10):</p>
<img src="./puml_e51.svg"><p>becomes with adapters:</p>
<img src="./puml_e52.svg"><p>We have omitted the shared database to better show the role of the connectors.
Adding it in we have the following:</p>
<img src="./puml_e53.svg"><p>The <code>DataAggregator</code> component is another adapter which queries the database and
converts the ingested data into a shape closer to what the client needs. For instance
an heatmap view (based on a specific criteria such as reviews, weather, affluency...)
or information about a specific resort. Clearly we can&#39;t expect the client
to analyze our database to extract the data he needs thus somewhere this missmatch
must be solved and the DataAggregator is the component serving that purpose.</p>
<p>Our &quot;Redux Actions&quot; component in the mobile application is an adapter masking
resquests to APIs and local storage and in general handling UI requests. A method
of its interface could for instance be</p>
<pre><code>dispatchShowHeatMapOverview()
</code></pre>
<p>which would fetch the required data through our Skip API and dispatch an action
to update our redux store accordingly. More than solving a missmatch it seperates
the concern of having to deal with HTTP requests and actions on the local storage
from the UI.</p>
<p>Our <code>Service</code> component in the backend is an adapter tasked with using the various
databases and the DataAggregator component to provide actions close to what
our controller needs. For instance if the API is requested to handle a new
update on the snow conditions by one of our users the controller
will simply make a call along the lines of:</p>
<pre><code>service.addSnowUpdate(snowInfo)
</code></pre>
<p>once validated the user credentials. Again more than solving a missmatch this component
separates concerns according to the ModelViewController pattern providing a simplified
interface for the controller to access (thus being a <code>facade</code>).</p>
<p>Other examples of adapters are the ones implemented by the libraries we use to
connect with our database both on the front and backend. Different databases have
different interfaces and, if possible, we don&#39;t want to deal with them directly.
Our service layer should not change whether we use Postgress, MySql or SQLite.</p>
<h1 id="3">3</h1>
<p>The backend <code>Service</code> component can be considered a wrapper around the business
logic of our backend since the controller doesn&#39;t have to be aware of any components
used by it.</p>
<p>A view of it as follows:</p>
<img src="./puml_e54.svg"><p>wouldn&#39;t be entirely accurate since the databases runs independently. We can&#39;t
represent them as part of the service but the controller is not aware of that...</p>
<p>In general every API could be considered as a wrapping facade since it adapts functionality
we don&#39;t see the implementation of to an interface.</p>
<h1 id="4">4</h1>
<h2 id="http">HTTP</h2>
<p>We are implementing a REST API for our application  and are also using
externally sourced APIs which will have to conform to HTTP specifications.</p>
<h2 id="sql">SQL</h2>
<p>We are using a SQL database to store data about our users. SQL is one of the
most used DSL for queries.</p>
<h2 id="geojson">GeoJson</h2>
<p>We will need to work with geographic data and GeoJson is the most common data
model used for it.</p>
<h1 id="5">5</h1>
<p>We are looking at the facets of the following coupling:</p>
<img src="./puml_e55.svg"><h2 id="binding">Binding</h2>
<p>Binding between the two components is done at design-time. The mobile application
works by communicating with a back-end we design.</p>
<h2 id="discovery">Discovery</h2>
<p>Discovery happens at deployment time likely in the form of an environment
variable with the url and credentials to access our API.</p>
<h2 id="session">Session</h2>
<p>The backend API will conform to the REST specification (with a possible exception
made to manage authorization tokens which might expire for security reasons after
some time) so each message will be treated independently from each other.</p>
<h2 id="interaction">Interaction</h2>
<p>The components are connected via a <code>web</code> connector so the connetion is
obviously remote.</p>
<h2 id="timing">Timing</h2>
<p>Both components must be running in order to exchange data.</p>
<h2 id="interface">Interface</h2>
<p>Any change in the API will potentially break the mobile app.</p>
<h2 id="platform">Platform</h2>
<p>No. The backend is running remotely so, as long as there are no interface changes,
the mobile app won&#39;t be aware of a platform change.</p>
<h1 id="6">6</h1>
<p>As mentioned before we need multiple adapters for the various sources of data
since each API will have its own data model.</p>
<p>For instance let&#39;s say we need the weather of a location:</p>
<p>A request to <code>openweathermap</code> will look as follows:</p>
<pre><code>https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=Cortina,ita&amp;appid={API key}
</code></pre>

<p>as we can see both provide similar data but in a completely different data model.
Our adapters will be tasked with converting this data to a common data model that
 the DataAggregator will be able to operate on.</p>
<p>As an example let&#39;s say that we want to work with weather data shaped as follows:</p>
<pre><code>{
  location: {
    lat,
    lon,
    resortId,
    resortName,
    country
  },
  wind:{
    speed
  },
  temperature:{
    max,
    min
  },
  date:{
    timestamp,
  },
  mainType: &quot;sun&quot;|&quot;rain&quot;|&quot;snow&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>A weather collector will first need to fetch resort locations (these are already
ingested by a separate collector in our DB) from the proper index of our
database (js pseudocode):</p>
<pre><code>asynch _getResorts(){
  resorts = (await fetch(&quot;${env.get(ELS_URL)}/resort/_search&quot;, method=&quot;PUT&quot;, body={
    query: {
      match_all: {}
      }
    })).body.toJson().hits.hits

    return resorts
}
</code></pre>
<p>then we have a method to get the weather from the resort info:</p>
<pre><code>asynch _resortToResortWeather(resort){
  rawResortWeather = (await fetch(&quot;https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=${resort.name},
  ita&amp;appid=${env.get(&quot;OWM_KEY&quot;)}, method=&quot;GET&quot;)).body.tojson()

  return {
    location: {
      lat: resort.lat,
      lon: resort.lon,
      resortId: resort.id,
      resortName: resort.name,
      country: resort.country
    },
    wind:{
      speed: rawResortWeather.wind.speed
    },
    temperature:{
      max: rawResortWeather.weather[0].temp_max,
      min&quot; rawResortWeather.weather[0].temp_min,
    },
    date:{
      timestamp: (new Date()).timestamp,
    },
    type: {Drizzle:&quot;rain&quot;, Sun: &quot;sun&quot;, Rain: &quot;rain&quot;, Snow:&quot;snow&quot;, &quot;Cloud&quot;:&quot;cloud&quot;}[rawResortWeather.weather[0].main]
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>using onthesnow, beside the data model missmatch, we would have the additional
 issue of dealing with  the fact that we store our own collection of resorts while
 they have theirs and requests to their weather API need the ids of their resorts.
 We could to slightly modify our method to enrich the resorts with onthesnow IDs.</p>
<pre><code>asynch _getResorts(){
  resorts = (await fetch(&quot;${env.get(ELS_URL)}/resort/_search&quot;, method=&quot;PUT&quot;, body={
    query: {
      match_all: {}
      }
    })).body.toJson().hits.hits

    extResorts = (await fetch(&quot;https://onthesnow.com/externalservice/resort/&quot;, method=&quot;PUT&quot;)).body.toJson()

    resorts = resorts.map(r =&gt;{
         oId = extResorts.filter(er=&gt; er.name === r.name )[0]?.id
         return oId? {...r, oId: oId}: null
      }).filter(r=&gt;!!r)

    return resorts
}
</code></pre>
<p> then similarly:</p>
<pre><code>asynch _resortToResortWeather(resort){
  rawResortWeather = (await fetch(&quot;https://onthesnow.com/externalservice/resort/${resort.oId}/1/day/forecast,
  ita&amp;appid=${env.get(&quot;OWM_KEY&quot;)}, method=&quot;GET&quot;)).body.tojson()

  return {
    location: {
      lat: resort.lat,
      lon: resort.lon,
      resortId: resort.id,
      resortName: resort.name,
      country: resort.country
    },
    wind:{
    },
    temperature:{
      max: rawResortWeather.currentWeather.tempTopMax
      min&quot; rawResortWeather.weather[0].tempBottomMin,
    },
    date:{
      timestamp: (new Date()).timestamp,
    },
    type: {Sun: &quot;SUN&quot;, Rain: &quot;RAIN&quot;, Snow:&quot;SNOW&quot;, &quot;cloud&quot;:&quot;CLOUD&quot;}[rawResortWeather.weatherSymbol]
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p> after that we would have to repeat the process for all resorts:</p>
<pre><code>ingest(){
 resorts = await _getResorts()
 weatherPoints = Promise.awaitAll(resorts.map(_resortToResortWeather))

 body = weatherPoints.flatMap(wp =&gt; [{index:{}}, wp]).map(x =&gt; JSON.stringify(x)).join(&quot;\n&quot;)

 fetch(&quot;${env.get(ELS_URL)}/weatherPoints/_bulk&quot;, method=&quot;POST&quot;, body=body)
}
</code></pre>
<p> once this collected data is ingested in the various indexes it can then be used
 by the DataAggregator component.</p>
<h1 id="7">7</h1>
<p>All the couplings in the mobile application are quite straightfoward already. The
only component with more than one coupling is <code>Redux Actions</code>, this component has
the responsability of handling requests from the UI and perform fetches if necessary.
To handle the possible outcomes of a request we  perform them one after the other
as shown in the process view of ex 8:</p>
<img src="./puml_e56.svg"><p>removing coupling between this component and the &quot;LS Service&quot; or the &quot;Skip API&quot;
would just make interactions more convoluted. The coupling between it and the &quot;Redux Store&quot;
is not direct as we communicate with it through the dispatch function. It is perhaps
similar to a bus connector.</p>
<p>Moving onto the API:</p>
<p> We are using a shared DB for the various types of data and have all the collectors
 adapters access it as active components to ingest data instead of
 having another component call them :this only makes them coupled to the shape of the data
  they need to read and write so we can&#39;t make it looser.</p>
<p> The backend &quot;Service&quot; component is coupled with the <code>DataAggregator</code>,
 the <code>User db</code> and the <code>Info db</code>: we could turn the <code>DataAggregator</code> into an active
 component writing directly to the <code>Info db</code>. At this point the coupling between
 the <code>DataAggregator</code> and <code>Service</code> component would be cut. On the other hand moving
 the cache from the control of the now active <code>DataAggregator</code> would be necessary:
 we can proxy the fetch function to use a cache when calling our <code>Info db</code>
  (or as a simpler approach just use a dedicated call to access it).</p>
<p>We would end up with the following connector view:</p>
<img src="./puml_e57.svg"><p> the <code>proxy caller</code> component could follow a very simple approach to maintain
 the cache which is to assume POST calls to our database are write operations
 (and the relevant index cache should be invalidated) while GET are always
 read operations.</p>

<li>What did you decide?</li>
</ol>
<p>What protocol skip should use to release a new version.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>What was the context for your decision?</li>
</ol>
<p>New releases are a critical moment in the life of an application, a bad release
can easily cause users to migrate to competitors. At the same time users expect
applications to improve over time and might not even agree that new features
are improvements.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>What is the problem you are trying to solve?</li>
</ol>
<p>We don&#39;t want to compromise the availability and reliability of our application
when releasing a new version. At the same time we want to avoid spending a
major amount of resources if possible.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Which alternative options did you consider?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>canary</li>
<li>shadow</li>
<li>gradual pahse-in</li>
<li>A/B</li>
<li>Blue/Green</li>
<li>Big Bang</li>
<li>pilot</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li>Which one did you choose?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>front-end: canary -&gt; gradual phase-in</li>
<li>back-end: canary</li>
</ul>
<ol start="6">
<li>What is the main reason for that?</li>
</ol>
<p>We want to give users some flexibility to update their application, at the same
time we don&#39;t want to confuse them with ulterior options to rollback their changes
and, at some point, we want all of them to move to the new version.</p>
<p>A gradual phase-in (obviously preceeded by testing with pilots) adapts quite well
to this requirements and doesn&#39;t need us to develop extra infrastructure. A
deployment with a canary approach might still be risky as canary users might
carry some bias which is why we complement it with a gradual phase-in.</p>
<p>The A/B method could be emplyed if there are strong doubts between two differently
designed versions of our applications but it might prove to be expensive to enact
and should be used carefully.</p>
<p>For the backend we are mostly interested in the fact that new updates won&#39;t
contain bugs and break the application so even users with biases will still work
which is why we go with a canary approach. With more resources we could compare
results users obtain from the new API with the old one via a shadow approach
but it would likley require tons of extra work.</p>

<p>Our backend can already be hosted on a separate server as is. The connector
view won&#39;t change since we are using a web connector.</p>
<h2 id="2">2</h2>
<p>We could make our application subscription-based however this would heavily
impact the amount of users that would use it. We would also obtain
less data about waiting times and quality of the snow on the slopes.</p>
<p>Instead of putting a price on our service we believe the best solution to be
ad-based monetization as the vast majority of apps on mobile stores does.</p>
<h2 id="3-1">3</h2>
<p>Clearly the higher the availability of a service the better with that being
said we don&#39;t have high availability requirements as a medical application
or a service for an enterprise would have.</p>
<p>If possible it would be preferable if the downtime were to be distributed
during low usage preriods (such as the night or outside the skiing season).</p>
<p>Since our application would not need to perform many requests even a relatively high
response time of a few seconds would still be tollerable if aptly masked by the
UI of the app (ex: show some cute mascotte or a fake loading bar while waiting for
  the response). Realistically we should be able to receive a response within 1.</p>
<p>Since the service is offered for free we would expect our user to have a higher
tollerance for unplanned downtime yet longer ones (more then a few minutes)
would lead users to perceive our application as unreliable and possibly part from it.
A few occurrencies of longer downtime might be accepted even during periods of
high usage but we should attempt to avoid that as much as possible.</p>
<p>Downtime due to planned maintenance should rarely occour as we could just
redirect the requests of our users to an older version of the API. Were it needed
it should be done during times of low usage when would barely affect any users.</p>

<p>watchdog</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>What is the main reason for that?</li>
</ol>
<p>With a watchdog we don&#39;t need to add extra code to our services and we will be
also able to monitor their response time which is important to avoid compromising
the usability of our mobile app.</p>
<h2 id="5-1">5</h2>
<p>The watchdog will manage issues with the system differently, in case of a response
not received from the service it will attempt to restart the component (we assume
the watchdog to have priviledge access to the container running the service in order
to order a reboot). If that doesn&#39;t solve the problem its only recourse would be
to send a message to an admin. We use multiple watchdogs to monitor each other.</p>

<ol>
<li>What did you decide?</li>
</ol>
<p>What replication strategy to use for our databases.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>What was the context for your decision?</li>
</ol>
<p>It&#39;s impossible to have a database with all the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>partition tollerance</li>
<li>consinstency</li>
<li>availability</li>
</ul>
<p>we have to decide what is is priority in our system and follow with an adequate
replication strategy for our database.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>What is the problem you are trying to solve?</li>
</ol>
<p>Since we need a distributed database in order to scale our application we need
to balance out availability and consistency in the best way possible for our users.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Which alternative options did you consider?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>no replication</li>
<li>synchronous replication</li>
<li>asynchronous replication</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li>Which one did you choose?</li>
</ol>
<p>user db: synchronous replication</p>
<p>info db: asynchronous replication</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>What is the main reason for that?</li>
</ol>
<p>We need to maintain consistency over our user database: if a user changes his
password we can&#39;t have the old one possibly working after confirming the change.
Only a few requests should be sent to this database so resulting slower response
time shouldn&#39;t be an issue.</p>
<p>For our info database eventual consinstency is enough, even if we don&#39;t provide
data from the latest state of our database there will be no issues. Since lots of
writes are performed on this database synchronous replication would significantly
hamper its performance. By default elasticsearch is a AP database.</p>
<p>Event sourcing with elasticsearch would be very expensive especially when considering
we might want to prune some data regularly (ex: we don&#39;t need to keep every weather
forecast especially after the day has passed and we have the actual data for it).</p>
<p>Event sourcing is eventually consistent so we exclude it for our user db.</p>
<h2 id="7-1">7</h2>
<p>We can already tollerate failures from the external API we use. If the API fails
we can&#39;t provide any usefult service from our mobile application so it will inevitably
fail.</p>
<p>Since our components communicate through a shared database its failure would make them
unable to continue operating, we could use a circuit breaker to avoid keep sending
requests to it or put the systems on hold after a certain amount of failures happen
within a determinate timeframe.</p>
<h2 id="8">8</h2>
<p>We are using external sources to fetch some of the data we need. If some experienced
downtime we could still offer older information already fetched and ingested from them
in the past. There is also some redundancy: we can get our weather both from <code>openweathermap.org</code> or <code>onthesnow.com</code>
so if one went down we would still be able to serve a forecast on most resorts.</p>

<p>number of clients since it&#39;s most likely the one that could cause issues in our system.</p>
<h2 id="2-1">2</h2>
<p>At the moment it doesn&#39;t as there are a few potential bottlenecks:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The API would fail to serve a large number of clients since it&#39;s a single instance
The API is a stateless service so we can easily horizontally scale it by having
multiple instances of it accessed through a load balacer. The standard DNS service
can already be configured to act as a load balancer so this would solve the related
issue which would work also if we were interested in making our application available
via browser in the future. Otherwise we could just add our own load balancer on top of it
Assuming the load balancer itself could become a bottleneck an alternative would be to
perform &quot;load balancing&quot; on the client side based perhaps on a mapping between location
and IP of the API, that seems excessive as a load balancer can scale vertically
very efficiently.</p>
</li>
<li><p>While elasticsearch is by design horizontally scalable the we have put a reverse proxy
to use a cache on top of it which could have consequences on the scalability of the system.
We could use the already existng reverse proxy as a load balancer but this proxy has already the
task of using a cache which would prevent it from being a hardware based load balancer.
At this point the best option would likely be to add a dedicated load balancer for the
various nodes and move instead the cache on the API.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>An advantage of having a proxy on top of all our requests to es was that we could
invalidate it once a write was seen, on the API we would instead be forced to have
a lower consinstency (ex: we could cache the information of a resort for a certain duration
  no matter what happens in our db, this would significantly reduce the needed
  requests to our dbs).</p>
<ul>
<li>At the moment the userDB is a single instance SQL-based DB which could struggle with many writes
For the user db MySQL Cluster is a solution adopted by many companies with high need
for scalability and consinstency like facebook. Similarly to the previous point we
could also use a load balancer here to split the traffic between the various nodes.</li>
</ul>

<li>What is the main reason for that?</li>
</ol>
<p>Master/worker pattern does not apply to our case as we don&#39;t have issues scaling
our input nor would we have any straightfoward way  to split our input.</p>
<p>We are explicitly using load balancers to redirect requests to one of the available
nodes implementing our stateless API.</p>
<p>Sharding is the natural solution to scale out databases and most implementations
also comes with internal load balancing between the nodes.</p>
<p>In the vast majority of cases solutions like MySQL cluster and elasticsearch will
 be able to support a very large number of requests with their own load balancer.
 That being said the node elected as load balancer by the db might still be
 insufficient so and unable to further scale up to forward the requests which is way
 we have added our own load balancer. An example for this type of solution
 is configuring <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elastic-stack-deploy/current/azure-arm-template-load-balancing.html">ES to run using an external load balancer like
 Azure Resource Manager</a></p>

<p>What discovery solution to apply for our dependencies.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>What was the context for your decision?</li>
</ol>
<p>In many cases software dependencies are dynamic: we know statically that our software
needs a certain type of component but not which implementation might be available
and where to get it.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>What is the problem you are trying to solve?</li>
</ol>
<p>We don&#39;t want our software to fail because it doesn&#39;t know which component implementations
are available and how to reach them.</p>

<p>Directory</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>What is the main reason for that?</li>
</ol>
<p>DNS is a form of directory based load-balacing and we have no controll over that.</p>
<p>We are also using load balancers to scale out which work with a directory.</p>

<li><p>Pick another use case scenario so that it can be supported without any major architectural change (i.e., while you cannot add new components, it is possible to extend the interface of existing ones or introduce new dependencies).

<p>Data collectors are one of the key components of our application: they retrive
the raw data we need and ingest it. Each of them uses a source of information
and converts the data to the mapping of we use for that type of data.
Some data might come from an external API while other from <code>json</code>
 other types of file, the location of which could be local or remote.
Given we might potentially use tens or even hundreds of different sources a tool
to streamline the process of writing a collector, testing it and monitoring or
tweaking (ex: change activation timer on a collector) its function could prove to be useful.</p>
<p> We want to implement our own DSL to write a collector that is transpiled to
 our implementation language. Programmers would still have the possibility to
 write a collector manually. In practice we could simply have a directory containing
 the collectors in our <code>.ourdsl</code> format and another where they get compiled
 into <code>.ourlang</code> files.</p>
<p> Together with information about the collectors it would be usueful to have a platform
 to monitor the state of our application.</p>
<p>Some of the active components of our application write to our database and we could
query the data written on it as a sort of pseudo-heartbeat monitoring however this
would not be an effective strategy as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The issue might be with the data source and not with our component, we need to
distinguish the different cases</p>
</li>
<li><p>We might want to test how much time some of our components take to elaborate
data and store this information over time. Perhaps a collector fetching from a
particularly poor API isn&#39;t able to provide data consinstently which we might know
about</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since we want to keep our components to keep operating alone we opt to turn them
into passive components but add a manager on top of them which runs them at specified
intervals of time or on request. In order to send these requests we add an API to manage
and monitor the component.</p>

<img src="./puml_e67.svg"><p>Process view 2, writing and starting DSL collector:</p>
<img src="./puml_e68.svg"><h2 id="3-3">3</h2>
<p>For what concerns our data sources:</p>
<p>We have designed our system to witstand breaking API changes: each API has
a different dedicated collector for each type of data we extract from it so that
would be the only thing to rewrite. Writing a new collector should also be faster
 due to the dedicated DSL.</p>
<p>We have put in place a system to monitor issues of this type with the collector
manager storing informations about the operation of each collector which are then
made available to the developer through the dedicated API.</p>
<p>The application wouldn&#39;t suddently break but, at worse, potentially serve
obsolete data if nothing better is available in the Information database.</p>
<p>We don&#39;t depend on other APIs at runtime and changes in those we use to deploy
our services would be discovered at deployment time.</p>
