For skiers
Who are deciding where to spend their day
The Skip app
Is  an application for mobile devices
That allows skiers upload and visualize information ubout the current state of the slopes.
Unlike companies that manage the slopes Skip provides its users with unbiased information on the state of the snow. 
There are websites that host reviews of ski resorts  but those are permanent reviews and likely not based on the present snow conditions. 
Skiers may also use forums to monitor the snow conditions (ex: https://www.skiforum.it/board/index.php?threads/55613/page-1966) but this 
requires the user to sift trhough multiple messages in the hopes of finding the information he needs
Our Project provides information and up to date data on the ski resorts close to the user at a glance. 
This information is provided by users through a quick submission designed to be compiled in less than 30s.
Reviews by users are weighted based on how recent they are and expire after a while so that the information on the slopes is always up to date.
