## ADR #1

1. What did you decide?

What discovery solution to apply for our dependencies.

2. What was the context for your decision?

In many cases software dependencies are dynamic: we know statically that our software
needs a certain type of component but not which implementation might be available
and where to get it.


3. What is the problem you are trying to solve?

We don't want our software to fail because it doesn't know which component implementations
are available and how to reach them.

4.  Which alternative options did you consider?

* Directory
* Injection



5. Which one did you choose?

Directory

6. What is the main reason for that?

DNS is a form of directory based load-balacing and we have no controll over that.

We are also using load balancers to scale out which work with a directory.
